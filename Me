Specialist researcher in nutrient intake, bioactive compounds and food contaminants. 
Extensive experience in nutritional epidemiology projects involving diverse populations, particularly vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children. 
A significant focus of this work has been exploring the relationship between diet and health outcomes, including obesity, as well as the environmental impact of dietary patterns.
Additional areas of expertise include related research topics such as adipose tissue browning, by-product valorisation, enhancing food quality, and gut microbiota.
A core methodological strength involves assessing dietary intake, particularly through the use of food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and food composition databases (FCDBs).
The primary research focus is currently on personalised nutrition and integrating emerging technologies into dietary assessment. 
Interdisciplinary collaboration is welcomed, as is the opportunity to contribute to innovative, interdisciplinary research initiatives.
